# Call Blocking Test Guide for Spy3 App

## Important Notes for Android 16+ Call Blocking

### Why Call Blocking is Challenging

Call blocking on Android requires different approaches depending on the Android version:

1. **Android 4.1-9 (API 16-28)**: Uses reflection with TelephonyManager.endCall()
2. **Android 10+ (API 29+)**: Requires CallScreeningService with ROLE_CALL_SCREENING

### Testing Instructions

#### Step 1: Install and Setup
1. Install the APK on your Android device
2. Grant all requested permissions when prompted
3. Tap "Enable Advanced Call Blocking" button on the Dashboard

#### Step 2: Add Numbers to Block List
1. Go to SMS, Calls, or Contacts tab
2. Tap the block icon (ðŸš«) next to any number
3. Confirm blocking in the dialog
4. Verify the number appears in the "Blocked" tab

#### Step 3: Start the Blocking Service
1. Tap the security icon in the top-right corner of the app
2. Verify it shows a green security icon when running
3. Check that the persistent notification appears

#### Step 4: Test Call Blocking

**For Android 10+ (Recommended)**:
1. Enable "Call Screening" when prompted
2. Set the app as your default call screening service
3. The CallScreeningService will automatically reject blocked calls

**For Older Android Versions**:
1. The CallReceiver will attempt to end calls using reflection
2. Note: This may not work on all devices due to security restrictions

### Expected Behavior

#### Successful Blocking:
- Blocked calls are automatically rejected
- Toast notification shows "Blocking call from: [number]"
- Call appears in logs as "BLOCKED"
- No ringtone or notification for blocked calls

#### Partial Blocking (Older Android):
- Call may ring briefly before being ended
- Toast notification appears
- Call is logged as "BLOCKED"

### Troubleshooting

#### If Calls Are Not Being Blocked:

1. **Check Permissions**:
   - Ensure all permissions are granted
   - Check phone app settings for call blocking permissions

2. **Enable Call Screening (Android 10+)**:
   - Go to Settings â†’ Apps â†’ Default apps â†’ Call screening
   - Select "Spy3" as your call screening app

3. **Service Status**:
   - Verify the blocking service is running (green icon)
   - Check notification area for "Call & SMS Blocking Active"

4. **Test with Known Number**:
   - Add your own secondary phone number to blocked list
   - Call from that number to test

#### Alternative Testing Method:

If direct call blocking doesn't work, you can verify the detection:

1. Block a test number
2. Call from that number
3. Check the app logs (logcat) for:
   - "Blocking call from: [number]"
   - "Successfully blocked call from: [number]"

### Technical Limitations

#### Android Security Restrictions:
- Modern Android versions restrict call blocking for security
- Some manufacturers disable reflection-based call ending
- Call screening requires user consent and system role

#### Device-Specific Issues:
- Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi may have additional restrictions
- Some custom ROMs block telephony modifications
- MIUI, ColorOS, OxygenOS may require additional permissions

### Advanced Configuration

#### For Developers/Root Users:
1. Grant system-level permissions via ADB:
   ```bash
   adb shell pm grant com.example.spy3 android.permission.MODIFY_PHONE_STATE
   adb shell pm grant com.example.spy3 android.permission.CALL_PRIVILEGED
   ```

2. Set as system app (requires root):
   ```bash
   adb shell su -c "cp /data/app/com.example.spy3-*/base.apk /system/app/Spy3/Spy3.apk"
   ```

### Expected Log Output

When call blocking works correctly, you should see in logcat:

```
D/CallReceiver: Incoming call from: +1234567890
D/CallReceiver: Blocking call from: +1234567890
D/CallReceiver: Successfully blocked call from: +1234567890
D/CallReceiver: Call logged: +1234567890|BLOCKED|1629876543210
```

### Alternative Solutions

If the app cannot block calls directly:

1. **Detection + Notification**: App detects blocked calls and notifies user
2. **Manual Rejection**: App provides quick "Reject" button overlay
3. **Integration**: Work with existing call blocking apps
4. **System Integration**: Use Android's built-in blocked numbers provider

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] App installs successfully
- [ ] All permissions granted
- [ ] Numbers can be added to block list
- [ ] Blocking service starts and shows notification
- [ ] Call screening enabled (Android 10+)
- [ ] Test call from blocked number
- [ ] Verify call is rejected/ended
- [ ] Check blocked call appears in logs
- [ ] Toast notification shows during blocking

### Success Criteria

**Full Success**: Blocked calls are automatically rejected with no user interaction
**Partial Success**: Blocked calls are detected and logged, may ring briefly
**Detection Only**: Blocked calls are identified but not automatically rejected

Remember: Even if automatic call blocking doesn't work due to system restrictions, the app still provides valuable call monitoring and manual blocking capabilities.
